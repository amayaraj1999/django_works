    <p>About Author</p>
    <h1>J. K. Rowling</h1>
    <p>Joanne Rowling  born 31 July 1965, better known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British novelist 
        and author of Harry Potter, a seven-volume series about a young wizard. Published from 1997 to 2007, 
        the fantasy novels are the best-selling book series in history, with over 600 million copies sold.
        They have been translated into 84 languages and have spawned a global media franchise including 
        films and video games. She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series, under the
        alias Robert Galbraith.

        Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty
        International in 1990 when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series. The seven-year period 
        that followed saw the death of her mother, the birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband,
        and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, 
        was published in 1997. Six sequels followed, concluding with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007). 
        By 2008, Forbes had named her the world's highest-paid author.

        The novels follow a boy called Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts (a school for wizards), and battles
        Lord Voldemort. Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series. Its
        influences include Bildungsroman (the coming-of-age genre), school stories, fairy tales, and Christian
        allegory. The series revived fantasy as a genre in the children's market, spawned a host of imitators,
        and inspired an active fandom. Critical reception has been more mixed. Many reviewers see Rowling's 
        writing as conventional; some regard her portrayal of gender and social division as regressive. 
        There were also religious debates over the Harry Potter series.</p>
